# PersonalPortfolio

The following project represents a personal development based on the templates of [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_templates.asp).

The page is structured in a very simple fashion:
* An index page contating my personal information and my portfolio, with personal projects, my CV and my social pages;
* A contact page that lets users send personal messages directly to my email by completing a simple form.

The list of technologies used can be found below:
* HTML & CSS for styling and organizing the webpage;
* [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for all the icons present in the website;
* [FontAwesome](https://formspree.io/) to handle the backend of the form in the contact page;
* Javascript & Jquery to make the page responsive.
